# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

Welcome to the **0x12. JavaScript - Warm up** project! In this project, you'll get to practice your JavaScript skills by completing a series of tasks that cover various concepts and functionalities of the JavaScript programming language.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both scripting and web front-end development. In this project, you'll focus on scripting with JavaScript to build a strong foundation before delving into more complex applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the basics of JavaScript programming.
- Write JavaScript code to perform various tasks.
- Manipulate variables, data types, and control program flow.
- Define and use functions effectively.
- Utilize operators and loops to solve problems.
- Work with objects and arrays in JavaScript.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

- A `README.md` file, located at the root of the project directory, is mandatory.
- Your code must follow the [semistandard style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) (version 16.x.x), which is a set of rules for writing clean and consistent JavaScript code. Semicolons should be used at the end of statements.
- All JavaScript files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
