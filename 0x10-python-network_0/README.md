## Description

This project covers the basics of networking and HTTP using Python and Bash scripting. It includes various tasks related to making HTTP requests using `curl`, understanding URLs, HTTP methods, headers, cookies, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll gain an understanding of:

- What a URL is
- What HTTP is
- How to read a URL
- HTTP request methods and response status codes
- HTTP headers and cookies
- Making requests using `curl`
- Sending data in HTTP requests (POST parameters, JSON data)
- Network fundamentals and scripting basics

## Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks that need to be completed using both Bash and Python scripts. Each task focuses on a specific concept related to networking and HTTP.

## Requirements

- All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All Bash scripts must be exactly 3 lines long.
- Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3.8.5.
- Use of `curl` for making HTTP requests.
- Follow code style using `pycodestyle`.
- Documentation for modules, classes, and functions is mandatory.

## Tasks

- **Task 0:** Display the size of the body of an HTTP response.
- **Task 1:** Display the body of an HTTP response with a 200 status code.
- **Task 2:** Send a DELETE request and display the body of the response.
- **Task 3:** Display all HTTP methods the server will accept.
- **Task 4:** Display the body of an HTTP response with a custom header.
- **Task 5:** Send a POST request with specific parameters and display the response.
- **Task 6:** Implement a function to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers.
- **Task 7:** Display only the status code of an HTTP response.
- **Task 8:** Send a JSON POST request and display the response.
- **Task 9:** Make a request to get a specific response.
